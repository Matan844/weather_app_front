To complete the task I used react and node.js . 
Additional libraries I used : axios - react , express,cors,bodyparser - nodejs
The site is fully responsive i asked to style in css vanilla so I split the folders to componenets and style.
I have taken several actions to prevent excess requests to the server:
For example, if you click check and no text has been entered, a request to the server will not be sent and an error message will appear.
In addition, once a request is sent, the button will be unavailable until a response is received from the server.
